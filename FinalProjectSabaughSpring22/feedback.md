# Feedback Provided From My Group

Being in a group full of experienced teachers was a very welcomed and valuable resource. The group was large, and I was not able to share much, but I did get some feedback from posting to slack and was given some general advice.

Ian looked over my lesson and script and felt I was tryiing to teach too much. He was right. I narrowed down the scope of my lesson to just teaching how to do a linear regression model using AWK.

Laks told me that I should limit my examples to only a few things. I took that to heart, and only demonstrated what was germane to my goal. I did, however, add one example of sorting to show how easy it is with UNIX and AWK.

Other people commented to make sure I stressed WHY this was an important skill to learn to make sure they stay interested.

The rest of the beneficial experience was just hearing my group talking about their projects. That was very helpful too.
