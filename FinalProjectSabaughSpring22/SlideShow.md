# For Keynote and Powerpoint presentation...

Due to the lesson slide show being slightly oversized to upload onto github with its 25mb limit, please use [this Google Drive link] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Em8YCS29NP23iFOq7IhC4HjWk6TaLTzp?usp=sharing "Steve Sabaugh's Google Drive")

There is a Keynote file (native) and an exported Power Point file. For best results, please use .key file as there will be no format errors.
