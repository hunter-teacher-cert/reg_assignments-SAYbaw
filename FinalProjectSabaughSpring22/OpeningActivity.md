# UNIX Lesson Opening Activity

Open terminal [if there is not a UNIX or Linux environment available there will be alternative instructions for replit]. At the CLI (**C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface) prompt type the following command and press enter. Please be aware that casing (capitalization) and spacing matters.

		pwd

This command prints your working directory or your current directory. This is your home directory. Now type 

		ls

this lists the contents of the folder or directory. In this folder, there should be a directory listed named “Documents.” To work in this directory, type the following command.

		cd Documents

You notice your prompt will now say Documents right before the prompt symbol [$, %, depending on version]. The command cd stands for “**c**hange **d**irectory.” To jump all the way back to your home folder, sometimes called “root” from wherever you are, type

		cd ~

To jump back to the directory you were just in the type

	cd -

You are now back in Documents. Let's make a new directory called “unix.”

	mkdir unix

Now let’s list our Documents directory to see that new directory.

	ls

Change your directory to unix.

	cd unix
