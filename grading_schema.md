# Grading Schema
### for Python CSV Lab
### By Steve Sabaugh

I would have two grading schemas for labs depending on how much weight these labs have on the overall grade of the class, and how these labs are done. Whether or not they are done in pairs, individually, as a class, etc. is the point of this exercise. If the point is to just get the work done and turned in so I see they have done the lab and we worked on it together as a class lab, this would be my scheme. 

     Did not attempt lab - 0/10
     Submitted lab, nothing would work - 6/10
     Submitted lab, most things work, but logic errors - 8.5/10
     All tasks completed - 10/10
 
If the labs have more weight and are done in pairs or individually, I would score using a 0 - 4 grading scale with the grade of 2 and 3 being essentially the same and the rubric looking like this.
