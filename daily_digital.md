## Why Russia Can't Survive Tech Sanctions

While much of the news is dominated by the financial sanctions on Russia, what might end up being harsher are the tech sanctions, most of which are being imposed by the industry itself and not by western governments. The article and video explain how crippling these sanctions are. Putin may not have expected how much maintenance is needed to keep Russia's tech infrastructure online. It is illegal to provide support or even documents to the Russians. Many do not realize how many services from HR to airline booking are done through technology companies. Russia is scrambling to replace these services. Not only that, their data centers need hardware that requires chips they can't get. Without their data centers, their society will crumble quickly. 

I would lead a discussion about just how entrenched we are in tech. You do not think about the radical effects it has on society until you are deprived of it.

I chose this article because it is a great example of what a tech disruption would look like, especially in the modern subscription-based model we have now where nobody owns anything just the temporary rights to use it. It made me think of tech in my life differently.

## Tech News Sources

I tend not to trust straight-up "tech news" (e.g, Wired, Popular Mechanics, etc.) sites for my tech news. These writers usually are no more tech experts than me, and you have no idea of their funding sources. They also lately have a political angle that I would rather leave to news sites. It is funny, that if you read the tech news from the major political papers, the tech stuff is less political. My favorite tech news is usually from reading financial papers like the Financial Times or the Economist. At least you know they have a political angle, but it doesn't show up in their tech articles usually and they are just concerned with the "bottom line," so you tend to get the straight truth.

I also have my favorite YouTube vloggers. You know whom to trust because all the good ones usually support and cite each other's videos. Watch out for the lone wolves. The good ones are really upfront with how they required the things they are reviewing and their sponsors are big sponsors who have nothing to do with what they review.  The only thing to be aware of is that you have to find your OS area. If you are a fan of windows, then you are not going to like my people because they tend to be UNIX and Linux people or Mac OSX and we do not care for Windows, so you won't get the straight dope about windows 11 from them. A good rule of thumb for me is to read and watch a lot. Get many opinions. My other favorite tech source although usually not cutting edge is technical societies like the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). They have tons of great editors that publish a lot.
