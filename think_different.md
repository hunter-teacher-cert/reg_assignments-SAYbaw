# Think Different
### Differentiation in CS Strategies
### By Steve Sabaugh

We discussed last class whether or not the best strategy is to teach a baseline and/or differentiate up or differentiate down. I have no experience teaching
in the classroom, so my only experience comes from how I learned programming as a freshman during undergrad.  I think I would want to teach high school students
the same way. When it comes to straight up writing code, I would teach at a moderate level to have my students understand the most essential concepts. I know
they are not all going to become developers, but I want to teach the basics as thoroghly as possible, while still teaching practical methods that they can use
in any vocation to give them more skills. So, my choices here are aimed at teaching programming primarily and not CS in general.

## Weening off block languages (Google Blockly, MS Makecode)

I'm sure some teachers can teach programming very effectively with block programming. If I have a choice as an instructor, I would not. I cannot prove it here, but
there is some evidence out there that it hinders student's ability to "think computationally." I also think it is easier to learn just to write the code. In the 
short term it is harder, but will pay off later on. However, I understand that many of my students may be used to block languages so I still could use them as a
support.

Scratch is terrible for this. While there is a version that is more verbose and you can write more code, it is not a robust language and is more of a toy or useful
in purly didadtic situations. Google Blockly has a Python or a JavaScript code panel next to the block area that the students can use as a reference on how to 
write the code if they feel more comfortable with blocks. The problem with Blockly is that this is only a "one way street." You cannot edit the Python or JS script
and create blocks. MS Makecode can, however, do this. You can write your code in either JS or Python, switch over to blocks and there are your blocks created from
your code. One drawback to Makecode is that it is limited to physical computing devices, such as micro:bit, etc., and game enviroments, like Minecraft and others.
All of the physical computing enviroments do come with a virtual software emulator of the device, so it can still be used without. I prefer the BBC micro:bit
enviroment. It is a fun little device that can teach all the basic concepts of programming (sequence, decision, iteration & IPO and structured programming) and 
uses JS and Python. If you happen to be teaching another language, the syntax is "C like" enough to help you with Java and any other curly bracket language. The 
micro:bit website has tons of teacher resources including classroom management. All of the MS Makecode enviroments have integrations with popular LMS.

I think of this like code complete in an IDE. If a student's ability is holding them back, this could be a resource to help them.
